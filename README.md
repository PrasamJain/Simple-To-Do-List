# Simple To-Do List Application
Develop a simple web-based To-Do List application that allows users to create, update, delete, and  mark tasks as complete.

## Requirements
1. User Interface - Create a clean and simple UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a front-end framework like React.js).

Include the following elements:
* Input field for entering new tasks.
* Button to add the task. List display area for showing tasks.
* Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as complete, an edit button, and a delete  button.

2. Functionality

a. Add Task: Users should be able to add a task by typing into the input field and clicking  the add button.
b. Delete Task: Users should be able to delete a task from the list by clicking the delete button.
c. Edit Task: Users should be able to edit an existing task. This could involve clicking the edit button, which changes the task into an editable input field.
d. Mark Complete: Users should be able to mark a task as complete by checking a checkbox  next to it. Completed tasks should be visually distinct (e.g., strikethrough or different color).

3. Data Persistence
Use local storage to save the tasks so that they persist even after refreshing the page. Tasks should be loaded from local storage when the application is opened.

4. Validation
Implement basic input validation to prevent users from adding empty tasks.

5. Styling
Apply basic CSS styling to make the application visually appealing. Focus on layout, spacing, and 
colors to enhance the user experience
